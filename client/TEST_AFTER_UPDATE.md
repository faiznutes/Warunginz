## 🔧 If You See Issues

### Issue: Dev server won't start
**Solution:**
1. Stop any running dev servers
2. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try `npm run dev` again

### Issue: Type errors
**Solution:**
- Check if `vue-tsc` version is compatible
- May need to update TypeScript types

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:**
- Check `vite.config.js` for compatibility
- Review Vite 6 migration guide: https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration

## 📝 Notes

- The cleanup warning about esbuild.exe is **harmless**
- It happens when files are locked (dev server, IDE, antivirus)
- Can be ignored or cleared by stopping all processes and running `npm install` again

## ✨ Success Indicators

If all tests pass:
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Application works normally
